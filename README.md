# Sublevel for iOS

You need latest Xcode to compile and run it.
Sublevel for iOS is written in Swift and uses the new WKWebView.

TO DO: Notifications

[Sublevel API](https://sublevel.net/developer/) can be used to pull JSON objects for each user if they provide their `username` in a settings panel. A background task can be used to fetch and display notifications. A third-party push notifications server can also be an option.
